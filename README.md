# Laravel Cheat Sheet

## Custom pagination URL
By default, links generated by the paginator will match the current request's
URI. However, the paginator's `withPath` method allows you to customize the URI
used by the paginator when generating links. For example, if you want the
paginator to generate links like `http://example.com/admin/users?page=N`, you
should pass `/admin/users` to the `withPath` method:<br><br>
`$users = User::paginate(15);`<br>
`$users->withPath('/admin/users');`
